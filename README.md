# AnimatedCharacter

Students will plan and create a fully functional website related to an animated character of their choosing (must be from television/film and be school appropriate).

You will first proceed through the entire planning phase of building a website. Determining your target audience, creating a sitemap, creating a wireframe, then finally creating a mockup. You must check in with me after each step before proceeding to the next. If I "OK" what you have so far then may proceed.

After planning has been completed you will then begin creating your site. For this project there is no page number requirement. However you must have at least a Home Page, About Page (explaining history/facts/etc of your character), and some form of Photo Gallery/Images page. Other than these pages you have complete creative freedom. The design, content, and any additional pages is totally up to you. Please keep in mind the rubric when creating your website.
